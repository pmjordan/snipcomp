# TOSCA Examples
This directory contains the examples used in the TOSCA v2.0
specification. These examples are validated here before they are
included in the spec.

The validation tests can be run using either:
1) bash_test.sh gives a count of valid and invalid examples and details of the first invalid example
or
2) python unittest test_examples.py gives pass or fail with reason for all the examples.

Both options require a local copy of https://github.com/tliron/puccini
